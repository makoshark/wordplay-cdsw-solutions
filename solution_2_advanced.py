# What is the longest word that starts with a q?

# This problem was somewhat ill-specified. What if there isn't a
# single longest word? What if there is a tie?

# We designed this problem with that ambiguity in mind, because
# sometimes the thing we want to measure may not exist, or may not
# exist in the way we anticipate.

# This solution keeps EVERY word of the longest length.
